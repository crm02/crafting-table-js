# Minecraft Crafting Captcha

A human verification system using Minecraft crafting mechanics. Users prove they're human by correctly crafting requested items.

## About
This project is forked from [Crafting Table JS](https://github.com/willybarro/crafting-table-js) by [willybarro](https://github.com/willybarro) and adapted into a captcha verification system.

## How It Works
Once the page is loaded, the user is prompted to craft an item. If done successfully, the user is told of the success. At this time, this captcha is client-side only



## Installation
Before you install, know that the project is running online using Github Pages, and installation is not necessary to test
https://crm02.github.io/minecraft-captcha/

### Option 1: Direct Usage (Simplest)
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crm02/minecraft-captcha.git
cd crafting-table-js
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Option 2: With Development Server
1. Clone and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crm02/minecraft-captcha.git
cd crafting-table-js
npm install
```

2. Run the development server
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser to the local server address (typically `http://localhost:8000`)

## Usage
This is a client-side only captcha. Anyone is free to adapt the code to work with a server!
